* bib2item
Convert a .bib file into a list of bibitems suitable for a journal
submission

Warning, used a lot of trim statements, not sure if they are needed
Make sure you check the output for spurious , or .

** Usage
bib2item <path/to/bib/file>

** Issues
For some reason extra spaces get added into the title and a few other
places.  No idea why.

The regex strips all special characters values.  This means if there
are any math or latex formatting in the bibtex values, they are likely
lost.

** TODO
Add switches for more formats.  Right now one is supported
Fix bugs in REGEX
